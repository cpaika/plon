# Claude Code Integration Test

## How to Test the Claude Button Feature

1. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   cargo run --bin plon-desktop
   ```

2. **Navigate to Map View:**
   - Click on the "üó∫Ô∏è Map" tab in the navigation bar

3. **View the Claude buttons:**
   - Each task card now has a green play button (‚ñ∂) in the top-right corner
   - Tasks that are in progress show an orange lightning bolt (‚ö°) instead

4. **Launch Claude Code:**
   - Click the play button on any task
   - This will attempt to:
     - Create a branch for the task
     - Generate a TODO_CLAUDE.md file with task details
     - Launch Claude Code (or VS Code as fallback)
     - Update the task status to "InProgress"

5. **What happens when clicked:**
   - If Claude CLI is installed: Opens Claude Code with the task details
   - If not: Creates TODO_CLAUDE.md and tries to open VS Code
   - The task status changes to "InProgress" and button becomes orange
