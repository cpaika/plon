# Freeze Issue Analysis and Fix

## Problem
The Plon app freezes after sustained heavy input (scrolling/panning) for approximately 25 seconds.

## Key Findings

1. **Timing-based**: The freeze consistently occurs around 25 seconds of runtime, not at a specific frame count
2. **Post-load freeze**: The freeze happens AFTER heavy event processing stops, suggesting cleanup or backlog processing
3. **Not event accumulation**: Events are properly cleared each frame by egui
4. **Not static state**: No problematic static/global state accumulation found

## Applied Fixes

1. **Removed blocking operations**:
   - Removed `runtime.block_on()` calls from Gantt view rendering
   - Made dependency loading async
   - Removed blocking task saves

2. **Optimized event processing**:
   - Extracted scroll data from input closure to minimize closure time
   - Added rate limiting for expensive operations
   - Added circuit breaker for freeze recovery

3. **Memory leak prevention**:
   - Limited debug data structure sizes
   - Clear accumulating vectors periodically
   - Skip dependency drawing for >500 tasks

4. **Runtime optimization**:
   - Switched to single-threaded runtime to avoid thread contention
   - Removed excessive task spawning in Gantt view

5. **Updated egui**: 
   - Upgraded from 0.25 to 0.27 for bug fixes

## Remaining Issue

Despite all fixes, the app still freezes after ~25 seconds of sustained heavy input. This appears to be a deeper issue, possibly:

- Resource exhaustion in the runtime
- Memory fragmentation after many allocations
- A bug in egui's event handling under extreme load
- OS-level resource limits being hit

## Recommendations

1. **Workaround**: The circuit breaker at line 179 of map_view.rs will prevent complete freezes by detecting the bad state and rendering minimal UI

2. **User guidance**: Advise users to avoid continuous rapid scrolling for extended periods

3. **Further investigation needed**:
   - Profile memory usage during the 25-second period
   - Check if there's a tokio runtime task limit
   - Test on different OS/hardware configurations
   - Consider implementing event throttling at the application level

## Test Results

- Freeze occurs at ~25 seconds regardless of optimizations
- Circuit breaker successfully recovers from freeze state
- Normal usage (non-stress-test) should not trigger the issue
