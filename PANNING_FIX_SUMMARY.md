# Map View Panning Fix Summary

## Issue Description
When panning the map view (using trackpad two-finger pan, middle mouse, or shift+drag), the panning would stop unexpectedly when the mouse cursor hovered over a task or goal.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by tasks and goals always using `Sense::click_and_drag()` for their interaction areas, which consumed pointer events even during panning operations. This prevented the map view from continuing to receive panning input.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Task Interaction Fix (map_view.rs lines 565-585)
```rust
// Only make interactive when NOT panning to avoid interference
let sense = if self.is_panning {
    Sense::hover()  // Only detect hover, don't consume drag events
} else {
    Sense::click_and_drag()
};
let task_response = ui.allocate_rect(rect, sense);

// Same for connection dots
let dot_sense = if self.is_panning {
    Sense::hover()
} else {
    Sense::drag()
};
```

### 2. Goal Interaction Fix (map_view.rs lines 747-760)
```rust
// Only make interactive when NOT panning to avoid interference
let sense = if self.is_panning {
    Sense::hover()  // Only detect hover, don't consume drag events
} else {
    Sense::click_and_drag()
};
let response = ui.allocate_rect(rect, sense);
```

### 3. Trackpad Panning State Management (map_view.rs lines 241-254)
```rust
if is_trackpad_pan {
    // Pan the view
    self.camera_pos += scroll_delta / self.zoom_level;
    self.is_panning = true;  // Set panning flag for trackpad pan!
} else {
    // Default: treat vertical scroll as pan
    self.camera_pos.y += scroll_delta.y / self.zoom_level;
    self.camera_pos.x += scroll_delta.x / self.zoom_level;
    self.is_panning = true;  // Set panning flag here too!
}
```

## How It Works

1. **During Panning**: When the user is actively panning (middle mouse, shift+drag, or trackpad), the `is_panning` flag is set to `true`.

2. **Task/Goal Behavior**: Tasks and goals check the `is_panning` flag when deciding their interaction sense:
   - If `is_panning = true`: Use `Sense::hover()` which doesn't consume drag events
   - If `is_panning = false`: Use normal `Sense::click_and_drag()` for full interaction

3. **Result**: Panning now continues smoothly even when the cursor moves over tasks or goals, as they no longer consume the drag events during active panning.

## Testing
A comprehensive test was created at `/Users/cpaika/projects/plon/src/bin/test_map_panning.rs` that tests all panning methods including the specific case of panning over tasks.

## Verification
To verify the fix works:
1. Run `cargo run --bin plon`
2. Navigate to the Map view
3. Try panning with:
   - Two-finger trackpad gesture
   - Middle mouse button drag
   - Shift + left mouse drag
4. Confirm that panning continues smoothly even when moving over tasks and goals
